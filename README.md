Java Game Abstract
================================
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Project aims to replicate a similar interface for creating games as developed in <a href="https://github.com/rcastro2/pygameAbstract" target="_blank">pyGameAbstract</a>.  Unlike the pyGame Abstract, no additional libraries are required except for standards libraries included with Java.  Below is a description of each application created using GameLib.java.

<h2>Flappy Bird</h2>
<p>
Flappy Bird is an endless runner game where you are challenged to fly through pipes collecting coins for as long as possible.  With each coin collected the game gets faster.  If you hit a pipe, the bottom bar or fly off the top of the screen, the game ends. Good luck but you win lose eventually!
